            <p className="mb-4">
              Sublmnl provides a platform that allows users to create custom subliminal affirmation tracks by inputting personal goals or intentions, selecting a category and background music, and generating audio files designed to support subconscious influence and personal development. The Service uses AI to generate personalized affirmations based on the user’s input, which are then combined with music to create a unique audio experience.

            <p className="mb-2 font-semibold">Subscription-Based Access:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">For tracks created under a subscription plan, your license to access them is contingent upon your subscription remaining active.

            <p className="mb-4">Sublmnl reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms. Any unauthorized use of a Generated Track will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
