            <p className="mb-4">
              Sublmnl provides a platform that allows users to create custom subliminal affirmation tracks by inputting personal goals or intentions, selecting a category and background music, and generating audio files designed to support subconscious influence and personal development. The Service uses AI to generate personalized affirmations based on the user’s input, which are then combined with music to create a unique audio experience.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Upon Sublmnl’s receipt of your full payment for a Generated Track, you are granted a limited, personal, non-commercial, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to access the Generated Track through your Sublmnl account for your private, personal development purposes only.

            <p className="mb-2 font-semibold">Individual Purchases:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">For a track purchased individually, your license to access it shall continue for as long as your account with Sublmnl remains active and in good standing.</p>
            <p className="mb-2 font-semibold">Subscription-Based Access:</p>
            <p className="mb-4">For tracks created under a subscription plan, your license to access them is contingent upon your subscription remaining active. Should your subscription be cancelled or expire, your license and access to those tracks will be automatically revoked. You may be provided with an option to purchase an ongoing license to such tracks at that time.</p>
            <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">Breach of License</p>
            <p className="mb-4">Sublmnl reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms. Any unauthorized use of a Generated Track will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
